Check Your Understanding Answers:
1. I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application. This is because this component isn't simply an individual part of the code and has outside interactions on an application/feature level, so a unit test wouldn't be appropriate.
2. I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application. This is because this component should be self-contained/individual and small-scale, so it can be easily targeted by specific unit tests.
